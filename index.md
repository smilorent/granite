# Key Principles

>[!summary] Learning is for Life   
>As a reflection of this mindset, all content within this repository is considered **a perpetual work-in-progress**, mirroring my continuous journey of growth and exploration. Expect ongoing updates and improvements as I navigate my way through various topics.

>[!summary] Perfect is the Enemy of Good  
>That means that the information here is **not** authoritative or complete, and is not representative of my best work. However, it is representative of my interests and current state of knowledge. If you have the same interests, then this space is also yours to use as a reference.

>[!summary] Constructive Criticism  
>Whether you have insights to share, suggestions for improvement, or just want to join the conversation, [feel free to dive in](https://github.com/smilorent/granite/issues). This digital garden thrives on community input, and your involvement is valued in cultivating a diverse and dynamic knowledge space.
