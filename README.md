# Granite

Welcome to my public [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault – a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)! This is my personal space for [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public). 

- **I am a perpetual learner.** As a reflection of this mindset, all content within this repository is considered an eternal work-in-progress, mirroring my continuous journey of growth and exploration. Expect ongoing updates and improvements as I navigate my way through various topics.

- **I do not let perfectionism get in the way.** That means that the information here is not authoritative or complete, and is not representative of my best work. However, it is representative of my interests and current state of knowledge. If you have the same interests, then this space is also yours to use as a reference.

- **Your feedback and contributions are welcome.** Whether you have insights to share, suggestions for improvement, or just want to join the conversation, feel free to dive in. This digital garden thrives on community input, and your involvement is valued in cultivating a diverse and dynamic knowledge space.
